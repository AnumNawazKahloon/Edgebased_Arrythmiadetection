## Edge based Arrythmia_detection
# Arrythmia detection at edge nodes by using LSTM 

LSTM is prefferable in sequential data or time series data for edge devices due to following reasons:
1. Ability to handle very long time lags
2. Ability to handle noise, distributed representation and continuous values.
3. It does not require a priori choice of finite number of states, hence, it can deal with unlimited state numbers.
